# Technology at P2PU

To execute our mission we develop and maintain several software tools. This document serves as an index for all the tools and projects we're working on. For things we've developed, this document will contain a link to the GitHub repo. The README file in that repo contains the project specific documentation.

At the end of the document there are links to some meta-level documentation/

## Overview

The most important projects are we working on on a regular basis are the P2PU home page and learning circles. The homepage provides a robust frontend for users while learning circles provides an API for the interactive parts of the P2PU home page. Many of the other active projects are extensions of this or components that forms a part of it.
