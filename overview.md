# Principles
 - Donâ€™t reinvent the wheel
 - Use what users are comfortable with - go where users are
 - Openly publish code and resources
 - Stay conscious of different context - low bandwidth, mobile, etc
 - Follow best practices - backups, security, testing
 - Practical solutions over correct solutions
 - Simple rather than complicated
 - Do one thing good rather than many things bad
